        <h2>Test & Validation Intern — Henny Penny</h2>
        <p>At Henny Penny, I worked in the Test & Validation department as an intern, where I focused on improving software quality through rigorous testing processes. My main contributions included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designing and executing detailed <strong>test cases</strong> and <strong>test plans</strong> to thoroughly validate software features.</li>
            <li>Using <strong>automation tools</strong> and <strong>Python scripting</strong> to speed up test case creation and increase efficiency.</li>
            <li>Collaborating closely with developers and QA teams to identify and fix software issues, helping to ensure reliable product releases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This experience strengthened my skills in both manual and automated testing, as well as in process optimization.</p>

        <h2>Sustaining Engineering Intern — Henny Penny</h2>
        <p>During my internship in the Sustaining Engineering department, I developed a desktop application from the ground up using <strong>C++</strong>. This app was designed to <strong>streamline communication</strong> and <strong>speed up processes</strong> between departments by providing real-time updates sourced directly from source code repositories.</p>
        <p>In addition, I independently tackled various <strong>long-standing source code bug fixes</strong> across multiple company products, delivering effective solutions that improved product stability and performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built the entire application <strong>from scratch</strong> in C++, overcoming language limitations with innovative programming techniques.</li>
            <li>Implemented real-time data synchronization with source code repositories to ensure the app always displayed the latest information.</li>
            <li>Resolved complex, long-standing bugs in existing products, bringing valuable solutions to the engineering team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This internship strengthened my software development skills, problem-solving ability, and experience working both independently and collaboratively.</p>
